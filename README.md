# function
 🎉 Just completed Day 2 of my Python learning journey! Today, I delved into functions, a powerful feature of Python. I learned how to define and call functions, work with function arguments, and even explored the concept of scope and namespaces. Excited to continue honing my skills and diving deeper into Python's functionality! 💻🐍 #Python #Programming #Functions #Learning
